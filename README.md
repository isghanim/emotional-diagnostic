This is an art project aiming to creatively use bash scripting to envision a dystopia in which our emotions are monitored and analyzed by 3rd parties.

When run, the script shows Miles Bennett Dyson interacting with Ada, an AI tasked with monitoring the population of a future Toronto now known as District 6, as part of his job as an AI Maintenance worker.

> My name is Ada. I personally ensure that all of our citizens are well.
